<h2>Jenkins Catalog Relevancy Ranking of Keyword Search Results </h2>

    <TD>
      <P>Keyword search results are now ranked to bring the best results to the 
      very top and to subdivide the remaining results based on relevance, with 
      relevancy based on where the search term(s) appear in the record. 
      Formerly, results displayed strictly in chronological order, possibly 
      causing a very relevant title to appear far down in the list of results if 
      it was not among the most recent publications. The results are most 
      obvious if you are searching a phrase rather than a single keyword.</P>
      <P>Search results now appear in up to 5 groups, from Most Relevant to 
      Least Relevant. Titles within each group are sorted by publication date, 
      newest to oldest.</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>
        <P><IMG alt="Most relevant" 
        src="http://jac.jenkinslaw.org:2082/screens/relevance5.gif" border=0> Group 1 
        contains the most relevant results; those items where the primary title 
        contains the single keyword or the multiple keywords as a phrase (for 
        example, searching the phrase "communist manifesto" results in all 
        copies of <EM>Communist manifesto</EM> by Marx being in this group, 
        regardless of publication year).</P>
        <LI>
        <P><IMG alt="Highly relevant" 
        src="http://jac.jenkinslaw.org:2082/screens/relevance4.gif" border=0> Group 2 
        contains highly relevant results based on where and how the term(s) 
        appear in the record. The single keyword or phrase appears in a subtitle 
        or other tile information (for example, <EM>The stages of economic 
        growth, a non-Communist manifesto</EM> where the phrase is in the 
        subtitle).</P>
        <LI>
        <P><IMG alt="Very relevant" 
        src="http://jac.jenkinslaw.org:2082/screens/relevance3.gif" border=0> Group 3 
        contains very relevant results with single keywords found anywhere other 
        than the main title fields (such as in a chapter title or subject 
        heading) and multiple keywords still found as a phrase, but in fields 
        deemed less relevant (for example, <EM>Marx in Soho : a play on 
        history</EM> has the phrase "communist manifesto" in the summary).</P>
        <LI>
        <P><IMG alt=relevant 
        src="http://jac.jenkinslaw.org:2082/screens/relevance2.gif" border=0> Group 4 
        further subdivides multiple keyword searches. Keywords are combined with 
        a boolean AND, and at least one of the words is in the main title or 
        subtitle. (for example, <EM>Capital, by Karl Marx</EM> has an alternate 
        title of <EM>Manifesto of the Communist Party</EM>). </P>
        <LI>
        <P><IMG alt="Least relevant" 
        src="http://jac.jenkinslaw.org:2082/screens/relevance1.gif" border=0> Group 5 
        contains the remaining results where all the keywords appear in the 
        record (for example, <EM>Leon Trotsky speaks</EM> has "Zimmerwald 
        manifesto against the war" and " Tasks of the Twelfth Congress of the 
        Russian Communist Party" as chapter titles).</P></LI></UL>
      <P>To bypass the ranking you can use field limits (for example, select 
      Author, Title, Subject or Note in the Advanced Keyword "Any Field" drop 
      down menu or include a:twain in your query). This is interpreted as a 
      power search and automatically bypasses relevance ranking to present the 
      results in a single group, sorted by publication date.
